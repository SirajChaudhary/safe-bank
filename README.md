## Spring Boot Application with Spring Security (default)

This is a **Spring Boot** application which is secured using **Spring Security**.

We have enabled default security to protect all endpoints. In order to access any secured URL (for example, [http://localhost:8080/hello](http://localhost:8080/hello)), you need to log in using the credentials defined in the `application.properties` file:

- **Username:** `siraj`
- **Password:** `12345`

Once authenticated, you will be able to access the application's secured endpoints.
